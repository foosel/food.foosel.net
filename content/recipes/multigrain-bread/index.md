preptime: 30min
cooktime: 55min
totaltime: 8h

ingredients:
- 80g rolled oats or other rolled seeds + some extra for the top
- 40g sunflower seeds
- cold water (225g + 70g, see below for details)
- 280g wheat flour (wheat 550, "bread flour" should work)
- 120g whole Emmer flour (or whole wheat flour)
- 14g kosher salt
- 3g active dry yeast
- 2tsp honey

equipment:
- large dough bowl
- two small bowls
- fine-mesh strainer
- bread pan, roughly 27x15x7cm

directions:
- Put rolled oats and sunflower seeds in a bowl together with at least 300g of water and let them soak for 2h. You can also let them soak overnight. The water will be used later, so make sure to use enough. The oats and seeds will soak up some of it.
- Strain the oats and seeds through a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl to catch the water.
- Add 225g of the strained wated to a big bowl. Add 70g of fresh water. Add the flours and the soaked oats and seeds. Mix by hand until all the flour is hydrated. Dribble the honey over one half of the dough and the salt over the other half. Sprinkle the yeast over the salted half. Cover and let rest for 15min.
- Mix the dough by hand for 5min. Cover and let rest for 10min.
- Perform a stretch and fold. Cover and let rest for 30min.
- Perform a stretch and fold. Cover and let rest for 2h-2h30min.
- Start preheating the oven to 230°C.
- Ease the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured counter. Put it into a somewhat rectangular shape roughly three times as wide as your bread pan. Stretch and fold both sides into the middle, creating a package roughly as wide as your bread pan. Roll the dough up from the bottom to the top, creating a log. Put the dough into your bread pan with the seam facing up. Cover (a shower cap works amazingly well here) and let rest for 1h30min.
- Brush the top of the dough with water and sprinkle some rolled oats on top. Carefully press the oats into the dough.
- Reduce the oven to 220°C. Put the bread pan into the oven and bake for 30min. Rotate the pan 180° and bake for another 15min.
