ingredients:
- 50g unsalted butter

- pepper
- a pinch of saffron (optional, only for color)

directions:
- Finely dice the onions. 
- Melt the butter in a pot. Add the onions and cook into glassy. Add rice and briefly roast. Add wine and let cook until wine has been soaked up. Add a bit of salt and a good amount of pepper. If you want to add saffron, do it now by adding it to a bit of the broth.
- Over the course of 20min under constant stirring, add the broth. Just add a bit and let soak up fully before adding more. 
- At the end, mix in parmesan, give a moment to melt, then serve.
