image: banana-bread.jpg
tags: baking

ingredients:
- 250g flour (sieved)
- 1 teaspoon natron
- 1 pinch of salt
- 115g soft unsalted butter
- 100g brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 4-5 very ripe bananas
- 50g chocolate chips (optional)

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 175Â°C. Crush the bananas (I recommend using a fork).
- Mix all dry ingredients minus the sugar.
- Mix butter and sugar until creamy. Add eggs one after another, then the crushed bananas. Add everything to the dry ingredients. Mix.
- Put into a buttered baking tin and bake for 60-70min. After 10-15min score lengthwise with a knife to a depth of roughly 1cm.
- After the time is up, let cool for 10min, then remove from the tin and let cool on a cooling rack.
